Wooohoo! I don't have to have a papsmear ever again! I guess that means I'm so old if I get cancer, they'll just let me die?

Eight HPV Types Identified That Cause Most Cervical Cancers http://ff.im/-siCgi
HPV 18 is a 'sneaky' virus causing adenocarcinoma  #NCISWS
Have you heard of Mothers Alliance Ireland? They don't think the cervical cancer vaccine is safe http://fb.me/vyCuzz18
Why limit HPV testing to 30 and over? Because risk of cancer in younger women is low,  but risk of contracting HPV is higher.  #NCISWS
@NettaBSays I'm not sure what doctor would do it, but men contract HPV too, so a pap smear seems possible.
American Taxpayers (you) just paid $3.5MM for a vax injury (HPV/Meningitis)- pharma does not have to pay out. YOU DO via vax court.
@SquintKev . buddddy youu didnt get the HPV one . hurt waay more . the vaccine like stung .

Possibly men are getting HPV, which leads to cervical cancer in women, in their neck and throat from oral sex. Oral sex is not safe sex.
@De_BadGirlBison Everything...hpv, chlamydia, anal cancer, vulva cancer, herpes, getting ur tubes removed, uterian cancer...she scaring me!
@dgakane The vaccine for HPV is not recommended by too many doctors cuz of its side effects.
Half yall hoes don't eem know when the last time you had a pap smear, how dare yall worry bout B being pregnant. FOH
@dgakane So if she is at that age, I hope she does not allow herself to be exposed to unnecessary risk of contracting HPV.
Powerful message from Dr. Jennifer Blake .... "If every woman got the HPV vaccine, I would never see another woman with cervical cancer".

Sheldon from Rhode Island, why can't you say ABORTION.  You keep saying pap smear.  Pap smear is not abortion.  Why can't you say it?

Time to start fighting back. They won't pass a budget with funding for pap smears? We won't pass one til cos pay taxes like everyone else.
Federal money has never been used to fund abortions.Women's healthcare--pap smears,uterine cancer screenings, breast exams, etc is the issue
I believe Cervical Cancer has been given a bad name.  Its not that bad, I've never worried about it. ~ John Boehner

During a two year period when I was uninsured, #PlannedParenthood was a godsend for my annual pap smears and exams.  @QueenofSpain
Planned Parenthood = RAD. Pap smears, breast exams & birth control FREE! Abortions only account for 3% of it's yearly services so FUCK OFF!
@speakerboehner My name is Laurie and I used #PlannedParenthood for BC & they saved my life w\pap test @age 18, cervical cancer cells found
I have friends who could've DIED w/out services like pap smears from #plannedparenthood. @speakerboehner why do you want to kill Americans?

#HPV vaccine also has the benefit to prevent serious effect cause by HPV type 45 and 33, but this benefit is still incomplete.

This is caused by the vaccine's adjuvant, not primarily bcoz of the #HPV vaccine itself. It's commonly happened after other im vaccinations.

So bringing up Gardasil disgrace is now a "smear" by people w/a nefarious "agenda?" The agenda is liberty.
Look, all our candidates are flawed. Romney has Romneycare. Perry has the HPV vaccine fiasco. Bachman has the fact she can't beat Obama.

@WTPnation I'm not worked up over the HPV vaccine, gives Perry a thinking compassionate side.
I told her I didn't want the HPV shot, but I've already had the 1st vaccination back in 2007, so she talked me into getting another one.
I'm not so sold on Gardasil as some, but I'm not letting one repealed policy one time turn me on a candidate.
HPV isn't a communicable disease like measles. How is it the proper role of the state to force gardisil on anybody?

Perry on HPV vaccine - 'I will always err on side of saving lives' - well said. Romney seems to agreed but dodged.
Romney not touching the HPV issue at all.  Not going to attack Perry on that one.  Smart.  #reagandebate
Perry doubled down on Gardasil order by challenging the TX legislature & told them they didn't have the authority to overturn it.
I can't believe Gardasil is taking center stage and they're more concerned about the executive order than the intent. #ReaganDebate
Perry is getting pounded on the Gardasil issue.  Mitt Romney just gave a very statesman-like defense of Perry.
Romney says Perry would probably do HPV differently. Says people on the stage want to help the country and Obama can't do it. #reagandebate
can't believe I'm saying this, but kudos to Rick Perry for pushing the cervical cancer vaccine #reagandebate
How on earth did we go from HPV to weapons of mass destruction? Republicans confuse the shit out of me.  #gopdebate
Although Perry was prepped for the HPV question - his "I hate cancer" line is an easy soundbite - it won't vaccinate him from more criticism
Can't believe someone hasn't hit Perry on the devastating stats of increased sluttiness due to HPV vaccine. #shotsmakeyouhavesex
Romney takes HPV question and works it around to a standard campaign stump line: Obama doesn't have a clue how to fix USA

RT @racheline_m: Linking the HPV vaccine to promiscuity is irresponsible as is deciding that only some people have the right to health.
Wish rick perry didn't backdown on the HPV vaccine. Saving women's lives is important. #gopdebate
@hipEchik I did appreciate the way Romney handled the Gardasil question. He rose above the usual garbage. That impressed me, it really did.
@mitchellreports interestingly Perry is anti-science w climate change yet obviously needed scientific data to back up need for HPV vacs!
@Eugene_Robinson The real reason Perry suddenly believed in science on HPV is because he was getting kick backs from Big Pharma
OMG PUNDITS. Pls just google the Gardasil HPV thing. PLEASE. he did it for lobbying, not lives! @hardball_chris  @maddow @MHarrisPerry
TouchÍ© in #ReaganDebate after shows "Perry believes in the science of HPV vaccine but not evolution or climate science"
MSNBC know nothings.  Didn't know that Perry rewarded his friends by mandating Gardasil vaccinations for girls. Not b/c of health.
I hate cancer prevention even more than the GOP presidential candidates!! HPV vaccine will give you AIDS!
@SarinaRhinehart Very surprised HPV was a topic... Thought jobs would be the main focus. #AmJournDem
@LauraLeslie Growing research is more supportive: esp for need in boys. Danger isn't just cervical cancer, also deadly oral/throat cancers.
I am not sure about the ethics of requiring an HPV vaccine. Who gets screwed when you have to opt out of this sort of thing?
@apriljoygavaza @slaterradio I was going to go, but I had to attend my daughters funeral. She died from the HPV shot.

I noted "inoculation" was word of choice, rather than "vaccination," when GOP debate turned to HPV and Gardasil. #reagandebate
Rick Perry doesn't believe in the science behind global warming but does in vaccinating young girls against cervical cancer. #Hmmm #2012
@LaurenLyster http://t.co/EJy1gat  HPV does not cause cancer after all.
Gov. Perry didn't mandate HPV vaccine cuz his concern 4 girls & HPV. His behavior regarding women's health proves that. #reagandebate

And here goes...the HPV debate comes up again! #cnnteaparty
Oh Perry is backing waaaaaaaaay up on the HPV vaccine.
Rick Perry says his requirement in Texas that girls get vaccinated to prevent cervical cancer was a mistake  #cnnteaparty

Perry is remorseful about supporting the HPV vaccine which would end cervical cancer. THIS is your teaparty. ANTI WOMAN. #cnnteaparty

One thing is for sure, Mitt Romney never mandated 12 year old girls get HPV vaccines. #cnnteaparty
To be honest, the Gardasil issue moves me zero. I don't personally find it to be a significant negative for Perry.
When Rick Perry's lips are moving #RickPerry is lying.  #Gardasil maimed and killed young women who had reactions.. #CNNDebate #CNNteaparty

oh boy. perry BETTER REGRET his fucking mandatory HPV vaccine signing statement. of course bachmann is missing the point. #abortionsnext
Perry says executive order mandating HPV vaccination was mistake, emphasizes opt-out availability, danger of cancer.
Perry: using gubernatorial executive order to pass HPV shots was a mistake, but not the principal.
HPV is like Perry's Achilles heel.
Hmmmmm - I agree with Bauchmann on something. No forced HPV vaccines for 12 year olds. & she took it too far, no longer agree w her. #debate
Perry's defense of the Gardasil mandate irritates me much like Romney's defense of Romneycare.
#CNNTeaParty RICK PERRY: Really? How about that big Merck donation, hmmmm??? #Gardasil #idiot
HPV vaccine was about trying to stop a cancer! Bachmann is totally out of touch when it comes to women and their bodies! How sad!
bachmann gets perry on the fact that his former COS was lobbyist for drug company that would have benefitted from HPV mandate
This HPV mandate issue not going away. Bachmann brings it up again tonight. Perry needs to come up with a better answer.
Bachmann points out that the drug company for the HPV vaccine was a huge lobbyist for Perry. Perry said the contribution was only $5k
There are several people in my feed equating Gardasil vaccination w other mandatory vaccinations. That's not fair. It ain't exactly mumps.
Bachmann is eating Perry A-LIVE about this HPV vaccine!! YASS MICHELE!!! #CNNTeaParty
Perry on HPV: "I will always err on the side of life"  What about liberty? Who says what is life? Can you force it on them? #CNNTeaParty

This back-and-forth on @GovernorPerry's HPV vaccine executive order is really boring. #CNNTeaParty
Bachmann: Can_ï¿½ï¿½t forget there was a drug company that made millions (on HPV vaccine). Perry says its contribution to him was only $5,000.
@jbouie i assume she's talking about Gardasil? and aren't all drugs-we-can-take "government drugs"?
Uh oh... Perry doesn't defend his HPV mandate very well...
The exec. order for HPV was a mistake, but not a wink of sleep lost after executing over 200 people? Okay. #cnnteaparty
Cancer is difference from HpV  vercine Perry.you are not qualify, simple
When it comes to women's health, bodies and the HPV vaccine, these teapartiers REALLY support a woman's right to choose against science
COS lobbyist was the REAL motivator behind Perry's fight against HPV #CnnTeaParty  There is no need for opt-out if there's no mandate, duh
Turned on the #cnndebate late to see Bachmann and Santorum attacking Perry over HPV mandate
Gotta tell ya, this crowd cheered #Bachmann hitting #Perry hard over HPV. #cnnteadebate
Okay Perry, I never swear on Twitter but Gardasil was a shitty vaccine. I got chills, fevers, dizzy and just flat out ill after each of mine
Kind of weird that Perry is getting hit harder on HPV than Romney has been on RomneyCare. #cnnteaparty
Good God. Is Ron Paul gonna get to talk anymore? No one talks to the gynecologist about cervical cancer? #RonPaul2012 #CNNTeaParty
As a conservative I have very mixed feelings on the HPV vaccine....particularly since it does cause one of the top killing cancers.
Perry gets up from Bachmann tackle on HPV, Santorum slams into him and puts him on the ground again.
@TeamBachmann - drug company made millions of dollars on HPV vaccine - it's not about life - it's about Perry donors #CNNTeaParty
HOLY SHIT!  @MicheleBachmann just broke out the axe on @GovernorPerry , insinuating HPV-cronyism.  Best move of the debate... #CNNTeaparty
Perry STFU you know you were wrong on Gardasil
Perry can't win on this Gardasil mandate by executive order. It just plain stinks.
Perry just lost his bid for presidency just now with the HPV debate #cnndebate

Santorum double downs on Perry. GOV gives VERY weak answer on HPV. Expect to hear a lot more about this one.

Crazy Michelle Bachman was digging in to Gov. Perry over Guardasil. Newsflash- teenagers get HPV. Stop being scared Perry, you signed it.
I don't think the HPV issue decides the election since Perry withdrew it, but it is a serious obstacle for him.
How can these 'pro-life' Republicans not want to stop little girls getting cervical cancer? Sick bastards. #teapartydebate
But didn't earlier generation get polio and chicken pox vaccinations? Flu shots? So what of cervical cancer. Yeah, we want that 4 our girls

Not sure we're spending too much time on HPV. interesting window into how Perry deals with criticism, having to flip-flop.
This may be my Beltway native tendencies, but I just don't think Gardasil is going to be a real issue.
RT @benshapiro: Why is Perry getting more heat for immunizing small girls from HPV than Romney is for CREATING OBAMACARE?
You know why they're against the HPV vaccine, right? It's because eliminating the risk of catching HPV might encourage girls to have sex.

Disgusting that these candidates are using women's lives as a political football in their ideological war against the state #HPVVaccine #CNN
@ClaytonMorris but most of America doesn't see HPV as something that important in their lives. For most it's a non issue. Perry was fine.

Compare how Romney handled his weakness (health care) with how Perry handled his (HPV). BIG difference. #cnnteaparty

Can someone PUH-LEAZE tell me what's the difference between an "H1-B" Visa and a mandatory HPV vaccine because right now I'm confounded.
Perry supported HPV vaccination because big pharma wanted the law I worked for. Perry regrets cancer prevention. It upsets theocrats.
My point being, she contracted HPV (not to mention other things) from her husband who slept around.
@MariahWestwind I know. It was the cervical cancer thing. God help us all if these cunts get hold of the USA.

@MattConrad it's been consensus legis w/ bi part support until killed by VA senate. I also put hpv opt out on phil hamilton's bill.
So.. what's so wrong with the HPV vaccine?
MICHELLE BACHMANN SHUT UP. GARDASIL WILL SAVE LIVES. IT'S NOT RUINING INNOCENCE
The Gardisil issue boils my blood like nothing else. I saw my mom fight cervical cancer. How could you be against fighting CANCER?!
Bachmann's opposition to the HPV vaccine is non-sensical unless she opposes all mandatory childhood vaccinations.
Who doesn't know the HPV has an opt out? No one asks? No one has a doctor to ask? So silly. You get the info, read it and decide. easy.
Listening to Michele Bachmann talk about hpv vaccination. Why does she keep talking about these kids like they were raped? This is a vaccine
She made over a HPV Vaccination though??? I had surgery to prevent cervical cancer and I don't think it's that serious Michele.
Michelle Bachman, girls that get cervical cancer don't get "mulligans" either, don't demonize the HPV vaccine for a political agenda
@bspward I don't agree with Perry on Gardasil either, but don't think it's a deal breaker. Romneycare is & so is his pandering on Soc Sec.
RT @presidentsantos: "That little girl doesn't have a chance to go back" to having a chance to get infected with HPV. Damn you, Perry!...
I suspect Gardasil will fade as an issue for Perry.  Immigration will not.  He needs better answers on those Qs.
Who knew that preventing HPV would be a radical idea? #CNNTeaParty
Perry has a serious problem when put on his heels. Made Gardasil exchange hurt a lot more than it should. #cnnteaparty
Bachmann is out of her damn mind. Girls "never being able to go back" from "govt injections"... going back to able to get cervical cancer?
Why does the hpv vaccination sound like shooting 13 year old girls when #MicheleBachmann explains it? #CNNteaparty

I agree &gt;&gt;RT @OHCONSERVATISM: I'm sorry. I can't agree with Bachmann on the Gardasil issue.
Or cancer... RT @thinkprogress Bachmann on CNN still hammering Perry's HPV vaccine decision: "Those 12-year-old girls don't get a do-over."
We're dealing with unemployment and poverty and violence and war and environmental collapse, and they're arguing about HPV vaccines?
Let's naively say teens won't have sex and give our daughters cervical cancer.
Perry meltdown during HPV attacks seems like big story that will have legs, no?
Bachmann on HPV issue: "Once it causes its damage, that little girl doesn't have a chance to go back." That seems a bit ... alarmist.
I am thinking if you ask a woman with cervical cancer now she would not have minded mandatory #hpv vaccination. Okay, #michelebachmann ?
@thepenspond Well, that in itself isn't anything to get too worried about. There are only a couple of strains of HPV that cause cancer...
@drewshane she's an idiot. Giving a HPV vaccine would be admitting that young girls will have sex. We wouldn't want them doing that! *gasp*
Bachmann on HPV vaccine: "I'm offended for all the girls & parents who didn't have a choice." Flip that to abortion. #prochoice #CNNTeaParty
@KatiePavlich Perry is taking way more abuse for Gardasil then @MittRomney takes for #ObamneyCare...which is a much worse offense
I am no Perry supporter by any stretch of the imagination, but I applaud his HPV vaccine decision. It should be required for boys too.
Dear Michele Bachmann, get your facts straight: 190,000 women die each year from cervical cancer, not the HPV vaccine. #cnnteaparty

I dislike Perry, but I don't see how vaccinating HPV is a bad thing.
@bethanyshondark @bccohan I'd read link that explains how else HPV is contacted aside frm sex. But still_ï¿½ï¿½Guardasil still not cancer vaccine.
.@Kirstycat1209 Bachmann opposes forced HPV vax because 12yo don't get a do-over. She'd force that same girl to give birth if she was raped.

@brendanloy defended his Soc Secty stance well, but was on defense most of time, did not articulate tuition for illegals well, HPV hurt him
Here's what nobody seems to get on the HPV-Perry stuff: so much goes on in schools behind parents' backs, TX parents recoiled instinctively.
234 executions deserve applause, women deserve cervical cancer, and the uninsured deserve to die. #prolifeGOP
"Mommy, now that I have my HPV shot, can I go have unprotected sex? Please?" I wonder if these people actually listen to their own crap.
@marinkanyc biggest issue for Gardasil is that it reduces risk but doesn't prevent, that is hidden in its marketing info
@MichaelBlum3 I have no problem w/ Gardasil. I have a problem with a mandate coercing parents to inject children. Via democracy or exec ord
Serious question though for the #Gardasil critics: If the vaccine wasn't associated with sex, would you be as outraged as you are now?
The Tea Party is reactionary group that prefers 'freedom' from vaccination over freedom from cervical cancer. #CNNDebate
Palin on Fox, continues to hammer Perry on HPV vaccine. Says he did it because of his political connections to pharma company Merck.
I don't get why liberals are so outraged by someone being against FORCED medical care (HPV vaccine). My body, my choice_ï¿½_ right, lefties??
Bachmann says a woman came up to her after the debate because her daughter suffered mental retardation after receiving HPV vaccines. #tcot
Unlike communicable diseases, cervical cancer does not endanger anyone else. So, leave me the F alone and stop forcing drugs on me.
Look, I think there are a lot of legitimate critiques of Perry, I just don't think the HPV thing is one of them.
My ob/gyn looked at me like I had 2 heads for refusing HPV vaccine. I'm an adult in a monogamous relationship. My HPV risk is likely over.
@dpixel given the cost and uber marketing effort I am very cautious about big pharma; gardasil was approved in a era of big drug recalls

@pnuts_mama It doesn't always cause warts.  You can have HPV, but can't see warts.
#Perry's position on #Immigration seemed untenable w/ #GOP generally - &amp; his issue with the #HPV vaccine issue. He conceded to latter.
@jkcarp1230 I hope that's sarcasm.  It's about preventing cancer, not sexual morality.  A virgin bride's "immoral" husband can give her HPV.
@moelane - if you notice, the  Tea Party crowd didn't like Perry's Gardasil defense.  Who's out of the conservative mainstream?
Don't know the minutiae of the Perry vaccine mandate, but my aunt died of cervical cancer so I think Gardasil is important
The facts r 1/3 out of ALL U.S have HPV..most strains dnt show symptoms. Those strains & cervical cancer strains can't be tested in men#tcot
Perry was wrong to implement HPV policy. Criticized it at Redstate at time. But rationale for it is hardly some creepy police state thing.
@AceofSpadesHQ There are more than one strain of HPV.  The most common one causes genital warts but doesn't cause cervical CA.
@bdomenech Oh come on. This starts with shots to prevent the herp/cervical cancer and it ends with Bladerunner. Don't try to reason it away.
ok, this #HPV discussion is out of hand. 50% women have it/get it. you do not need to be promiscuous. can't HPV cause cancer? Y not kill it?
@MicheleBachmann The HPV vaccine is to prevent our young women from having to combat the effects of this virus such as Cervical Cancer.
@BiasedGirl not knocking Perry's decision on the HPV vacc, although I don't think he handled it well. Bachmann's point on XOs is important.
That would be HPV vax MT @michellemalkin: ALL the candidates are flawed. Much of vetting process is figuring out which bother you the least.
If we can KILL a cancer causing virus, should Government mandate it? #discuss #hpv #cnnteaparty a woman can get it by being with 1 man.

Bachmann on HPV: "I didn't make that claim and I didn't make that statement." the one she claimed and stated after the last debate?
Michele Bachmann is lying. No 12 year old girl in Texas was ever forced to get the HPV vaccine #GOPDebate
MIchele Bachmann defends passing along unproven charge that Gardasil caused woman's daughter's retardation. #gopdebate
Bachmann keeps saying she was only repeating HPV-retardation comment. Why no follow-up on why she's repeating random claims? #DebateTheFix
I don't like Bachman, but I agree with what she's saying about HPV vaccine mandates.
Michele Bachmann: "I DID NOT IMPLY WHAT YOU HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE OF ME IMPLYING ABOUT HPV."
Bachmann doesn't back down on HPV/Perry. Shows she's still a fighter, not made timid by press pushback. Smart tie to crony capitalism.
Haven't we covered this topic enough? Bachmann and Perry over Gardasil. #gopdebate
Hey give Bachman a break will you, she can't help it if she is retarded, she had a cervical cancer prevention injection
#Bachmann tries to sidestep HPV controversy...simply relating someone else's story isn't sufficient #gopdebate
Perry is making a mistake by defending his HPV mandate now. He should be talking about Bachmann's irresponsible statement, instead.
Ok, I want to know the google search stats on gardasil... c'mon Fox, don't let me down!
Bachmann as a mother of 2,500 kids is tearing up Perry on HPV  issue. #gopdebate

Perry defense on HPV goes to the personal. Woman with cervical cancer who lobbied him. #gopdebate #debatethefix

Perry met Heather Burcham, the woman who died of cervical cancer, AFTER he issued the executive order.

Perry on HPV: "admitted we should have an opt in...but i don't know what part of opt-out that parents don't get" #gopdebate
I do not agree with mandating the #HPV (or any) vaccine, but I think those who refuse vaccines shouldn't get gov't money for treatment.
I'm sick of the gardasil issue. It wasn't implemented, it ended up being optional. Who cares?
@hardball_chris Bachman's digging herself in a whole She will not admit she erred re HPV statement
Bachmann can't understand why the government won't give young girls the freedom to have cervical cancer. #tweetthepress

Fact.. Gardasil CAN cause serious side affects.. so screw all you idiots!! The decision is not for u freaks to make
Perry says he "got lobbied" by a cancer victim. Reporters nail him -- He met her after he issued HPV mandate. #gopdebate
Just as Perry has his HPV vaccine answer down, Romney has his RomneyCare answer down as well. #GOPDebate
@EmilyMiller I admit I don't know what HPV is, but students are MANDATED to get numerous vacinations before they attend school.
Perry defending HPV: I got lobbied by a sick woman.  That sick woman made me make this mistake... Basically...
@dickmorristweet Worse, he's in free fall now.  Gardasil was a terrible response as well.
Somewhere, a magnetic gay soldier with HPV is watching this debate and crying.
Still thinking about Perry HPV response. He did well this time, but "I was lobbied" is probably not a good explanation to start with.
@mattklewis HPV + cronyism does not help Rick Perry at all.

Dudes you better think about goin down on a chic..Women don't know if they might have cervical cancer and it has been givin guys ORAL CANCER

"HPV could be causing more throat cancer than cervical cancer by 2020. " - Whoa.. Now that is scary!
"If the trend continues, by 2020 HPV will be causing more throat cancer than cervical cancer, the study concluded." WOWSIES.
Is it too late for me to get the HPV vaccine? I know they were saying the cut off was 25 but I'm saying...
Smh STOP BEING NASTY PPL RT @WWMDtv: "HPV could be causing more throat cancer than cervical cancer by 2020. " - Whoa.. Now that is scary!
@luvvieig my understanding is that there are different kinds of HPV and that only 1 causes cancer. So the 50% covers all types not THE one.
"@PatriciaFalona: 50% of all adults have HPV. And you can get it even w/ condoms because it's skin-to-skin contact transmitted."
@SoopDeVille @Kimberly_Inc and it does not protect you against anything.. HPV vaccine is also v. dangerous. google its serious side effects

How many men would consider taking the HPV vaccine?  (if they chose not to use dental dams to prevent infection) http://t.co/k8AQiL1u
So condoms don't protect against HPV?? Fuck a condom then. Gonna have to start wrapping our entire bodies in plastic.
@NancyLeeGrahn Want to bet that now that men are getting cancers due to HPV it won't be a destruction to society to mandate the vaccine?
Got my hpv jabs tommorow! Gonna dieeee!:'(
Oral sex can cause throat cancer if that wee wee has HPV...#medicalfact
"_ï¿½ï¿½The burden of cancer caused by HPV is going to shift from women to men in this decade,_ï¿½ï¿½
My #PublicHealth tweet for the day: both men and women can receive and transmit HPV, and both groups are eligible for vaccination.

@HarrietMcLea I read your article, I'm confused: Why do young boys need a HPV vaccine? Does US Centres believe they engage in oral sex?
Van zyl suggested the HPV vaccine should be given not only to girls to prevent cervical cancer, but also to boys to prevent oral cancers O_o
@londyMyeza the cancer risk does increase, but the study seems to say that there are merely more HPV related cancers than non HPV... hrm.
Throat cancer in men is linked to hpv from women. Now when dude say he don't munch yall still better let him hunch lmao
Just heard on the radio that men can get throat cancer from eating the box if she has HPV. #RIP
Wowwwww throat cancer is up in men. Why? Because of HPV transfer during oral sex! #crazy
So I guess eating the box is the new thing cuz throat cancer is on the rise! If a girl has HPV ima need u all to leave her alone!
@WriteWithStan HPV's becoming the major cause of head and neck cancer.
Hpv is the cause they say
But by that same thought process. Can't women get throat cancer too?  Since men are HPV carriers??  #damndamnnnDAMN
@shOoObz crazy i thought it was smoking too, but smoke been a cause, so the they reason its up is hpv....crazy lol

#Shytjusgotreal: Throat cancer is at an all time high due to heauxs walking around with that ol' HPV in their vah jay jay.
@Twitless_Ghost Nope. HPV is the most common STD. There are several strands, most are non-cancerous & in men there are no symptoms usually.
@Long_N_SexyLegs Yep, guys can't be going around eating on any chic! They better ask when is the last time she had a Pap Smear #seriously

@iAmMrBraxton na dumb ass louisana black said all that there are dumb ass women in this world gential warts is the worst 30 types of HPV
@medskep Do you think HPV vaccination reduces the risk of cervical cancer? Why would reducing pre-cancers not mean fewer cancers?
Fellas, think only the ladies need the HPV vaccine? Only if you don't care about throat/penis/anal cancer. http://ow.ly/6NiGA
Oral cancer in men caused by HPV. Watch who u eat fellas. All p*ssy ain't healthy p*ssy.

Genital HPV infections usually clear up on their own. If one becomes chronic, it can cause changes in the cells of the cervix.
Some types of the HPV virus may cause genital warts, but these are not the same strains linked to cervical cancer.
RT @DrInHiding: HPV infections usually have no symptoms and go away on their own.
RT @DrInHiding: Some types of the HPV virus may cause genital warts, but these are not the same strains linked to cervical cancer.
Because HPV can linger quietly, it's possible to carry the infection even if it has been years since you had sex.
Condoms can lower your risk of getting HPV, but they do not fully protect against the virus.
Women are surviving #HIV but many who are infected are dying of cervical cancer. More on this topic at @aids2012 http://t.co/VxauelW6
The vaccines r only used 2 prevent, NOT treat, HPV infection.They r most effective if administered b4 an individual becomes sexually active.

Men and women can carry most strains of HPV, and it's OFTEN passed back and forth during sex. However.
MEN are the carriers of HPV strains 16 and 18, the most common causes of cervical cancer.
Condoms DO NOT protect against HPV. No strains of the virus are passed through semen; it lives on the man's scrotum.

HPV can be transmitted through many kinds of sexual activity. #CDCCancerChat
You can't get HPV on your cervix from toilet seats. #CDCCancerChat
Myth: If you have HPV, you'll probably get cerv cancer. Fact: HPV is very common, but cerv cancer isn't #CDCCancerChat http://t.co/Ds7ll42P
Girls 11-12 years old should get HPV shots. Girls &amp; women ages 13-26 should get it if not vaccinated earlier. #CDCCancerChat

HPV vaccines protect against 2 of the HPV types that cause 70% of cervical cancers. #CDCCancerChat
This means 30% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV types NOT included in the vaccines. #CDCCancerChat
That's why it's important to get screened even though you had the HPV vaccine. #CDCCancerChat
@DocStukie 
Girls 11-12 years old should get HPV shots. Girls &amp; women ages 13-26 should get it if not vaccinated earlier. #CDCCancerChat

Multiple sexual partners is a big risk factor for cervical cancer. #NM
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women, after breast cancer and yet many women know nothing about it. #NM
Current estimates indicate that every year 14,550 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 9659 die from the disease. #NM

What is genital HPV infection? Genital human papillomavirus (also called HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI).
There are more than 40 types of HPV that can infect the genital areas of males &amp; females. These HPV types can also infect the mouth/throat.
There is no certain way to tell who will develop health problems from HPV and who will not.
All cases of genital warts and RRP, and nearly all cases of cervical cancer, are caused by HPV
May is Cervical Cancer Awareness month. I just found out that my risk for cervical cancer is very high. Will get my result in 10 days.

"@SlimmIsChillin: But an anal papsmear?! No. Way. No way am I subjecting myself to that!" / I've nvr heard of that. My gosh.

Girls don't contract HPV out of thin air. It takes two. Stop saying "vaccinate your daughters." Start saying "vaccinate your children."
HPV itself isn't an STI, many people have different strains of HPV, usually your body fights them off or just don't do anything inside you.
Before u eat a girl out, make sure she doesn't have HPV so u don't get throat cancer lmao

Man alive Michael Douglas is a twat. HPV is spread by all kinds of sexual contact and many people carry it, not just by pleasuring ladies.

You do not need to engage in intercourse to contract #HPV. The virus can be spread simply by kissing or touching someone. #FB
We focus on the wrong things too often. What folks should take away from the sitch is fact that HPV CAN cause more than cervical cancer
He claimed his throat cancer was caused by HPV. Clearly no link to his smoking or drinking through. What a washout. @HisFeministMama
! RT @iLuvvit I hate the convo around Michael Douglas revelation that his cancer was caused by HPV. It shows us that stigma is real outchea.

Wtf bruh RT @KisstheSavage Eating the box does not cause throat cancer. He ate HPV box smh
@MichaelFil Well, blaming the women he was with whence performing that particular activity for getting the HPV that caused his cancer. Alas?
He said eating his wife's HPV riddled pussy caused that shit. _ï¿½ï¿½@itsjustmelise: @andrewschulz  how?_ï¿½ï¿½
Everyone is only talking about getting HPV from eating pussy. Newsflash: you get it from sucking cock, too.
Angelina Jolie talking about a preventative operation is considered brave, but Michael Douglas talking about HPV causing throat cancer isn't
Michael douglas got hpv in his mouth and throat and publicly announced he got it from " eating pussy " _ï¿½ï¿½_ #dead
Doctors know, however, that oropharyngeal cancers caused by HPV are  easier to treat than those caused by factors like smoking and drinking.

Dear Everyone, Sex does not make you a slut. Having HPV does not make you a slut. Or a slag. Or dirty. It means you had sex w/o protection.

One thing is clear:  Most people who get oral #HPV infections do not have any signs, symptoms, and certainly do not get oral cancer.
So some actor got cancer because of oral sex and contracting hpv.... That's a hell of a lot of oral sex

michael douglas said he got throat cancer from hpv from giving his wife head.  damn put himself n catherine zeta on blast
So Michael Douglas got oral cancer from HPV, which he got from eating an absurd amount of pussy, and not decades of drinking/smoking?
@adirado29 I'm sure she's well-accquainted with his medical issues &amp; cancer cause &amp; knows what he meant. Men are the carriers of HPV anyways
@WCoastPrincesse did you get the hpv vaccine, i didn't but now I'm thinking about it.
Experts are saying HPV can be contracted via oral sex. So why no talk about women's risk when giving oral pleasure to a man?
HPV can be one of the many causes of throat cancer. Stop suck dicks and lick pussies

@Hpvr I need a fry up and a million pound But that's not happening anytime soon looool x
HPV can cause serious health problems, including genital warts and certain cancers #HPV
There is no certain way to tell who will develop health problems from HPV and who will not #HPV
#NOTE Both viruses can be passed on during sex, but they have different symptoms and cause different health problems #HPV
A person can still have HPV, even if years have passed since he or she has had sexual contact with an infected person #HPV
All cases of genital warts and RRP, and nearly all cases of cervical cancer, are caused by HPV #HPV
The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types of HPV that can cause cancers #HPV
Cervical cancer usually does not cause symptoms until it is quite advanced #HPV
For this reason, it is important for women to get regular screening for cervical cancer #CervicalCancer #HPV
In most cases the virus goes away and it does not lead to any health problems #HPV
However, when the virus persists, or does not go away, HPV can cause normal cells to become abnormal and... (1/2)  #HPV

There are several ways that people can lower their chances of getting HPV: #HPV
HPV vaccines are safe &amp; effective,&amp;can protect males&amp; females against some of d most common types of HPV that can lead to disease and cancer
Girls&amp; women: Two vaccines (Cervarix &amp; Gardasil) are available to protect females against the types of HPV that cause most cervical cancers.

@LL_Cool_X That'a your community dear. It's not like that in a lot of places. Cervical cancer is killing women and must of it is politics.
80% of women will have HPV according to Dr. OZ And its a std that can lead to cervical cancer &amp; infertility. It can be dormant for 10/20yrs
@twitsanon Asside that many deaths and other issues have been shown to be cause by the HPV jab, eh?  [shrug] Ok.
My arm still hurts from that HPV shot I got yesterday &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; _ï¿½ï¿½_
@_Awins a pap smear, you wouldn't understand. Lol.
To people who have had the cervical cancer injection... Is it really bad??
Why should men get the HPV vaccine? Because you shouldn't get throat cancer from eating pussy, that's why.
Fuck getting my HPV shot-.-
Between football, the gym, and getting my 3rd gardasil shot its safe to say i can't feel any part of my body right now
I feel like such a girl since I got an HPV shot today
I get a papsmear tomorrow for my annual exam. That shit hurts

Pap smears have never killed anyone. Pap smears are an effective screening tool to prevent cervical cancer. Risky HPV vaccines are unwise.

Pap smears only take 5mins it's over in no time. The most uncomfortable part is the fingers inside just browsing
And today in Internalized Misogyny News, women are shaming other women for finding pap smears painful/uncomfortable.
Vaccine Myth: My kid is too young. I'll get the HPV vax when I'm ready to think about them having sex.
Vaccine myth: We don't need HPV vaccines, Pap smears already detect &amp; treat precancer.
Also, Pap smears are NOT supposed to hurt. Some doctors do scrape cells to get a better sample but otherwise...no.

Vaccine myth: I/my kid doesn't have a cervix, they don't need the HPV vaccine.
#vaxfacts: HPV vax protects against the penile, anal, head&amp;neck, &amp; vulvar cancers caused by HPV.

.@MelindaKrakow There are more than 100 types of #HPV, at least 13 are cancer-causing. HPV 16 &amp; 18 known to cause 70% of cervical cancers
#HPV vaccination does not replace cervical cancer screening http://t.co/0hABGu2pM6
@katiecouric @KatieShow there is no 'controversy': the HPV vaccine is safe and prevents potentially deadly cervical and oropharyngeal cancer

What is #HPV ? Human Papilloma Virus - the most commonly sexually transmitted infection. It can cause cervical cancer and/or genital warts
Most people have #HPV  and don't know about it.
My advice ï¿½_ get your daughters vaccinated against #HPV - regardless of sexual activity.
Three doses of the #HPV vaccine are needed. The vaccine is not cheap. Not all schools are going to get it.
Ladies - when was your last #PAP smear? Never had one? Please go and get one done #HPV
The reason proponents of the HPV vaccine are saying any child should be vaccinated is because despite not being affected, you can pass it.
@sindivanzyl there is no cure for hpv right?
@LionoftheNight Because the vaccine protects against some throat and anal cancers... plus it protects your partner from cervical cancer.
I can honestly say that getting my HPV vaccine hurts more than being stabbed

@NolteNC Also, HPV is spread by sexual contact, not by being in the same room with a symptomless person.

"'This [vaccine] work for me and my values and my family,'"  http://t.co/Ah9H9LESVk  He means HPV.
Choosing a vaccine based on "values"?  They are tlaking about not vaccinating their daughters against HPV.
#TYTLive Jimmy is right about HPV.  they want women to die, or have babies they can't take care of.  Ya know, pay big time for having sex
@beebigelow The unmentioned vaccine they are almost all referencing is HPV, which they think causes a mental disorder called "sluttiness."

Using a condom is protective but HPV can also be spread by genital skin-to-skin contact so practicing safe sex is not enough. #WCD #ydsrh
Screening can reduce cervical cancer deaths by 80% or more among women. #WorldCancerDay #NotBeyondUs
@WHO @piyu009 but isn't that a technicality for most people? communicable diseases can cause cancer... HPV and other viruses too...
