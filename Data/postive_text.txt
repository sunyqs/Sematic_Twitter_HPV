@fortunefreak I had a pap smear come back with cancerous cell growth, I had a biopsy done today and will have my cervex froze in 3 weeks.
@abby_cake @TheBloggess I am appalled that he is back pedaling on the HPV vaccines already.
Apparently compulsory HPV vaccinations is an is issue in the GOP race. So seriously F*^&ed up. is.gd/hp9ZaY
Anytime u come 2 Dr.Hooter/Dr.Rabie office...everybody think u pregnant!Mercy!It's just a pap smear! Beats the Health Unit! #smdh!Lol
Are oral lesions contagious? Well, some are and some aren't. The question is a good one considering the spread of HPV (virus).
I probably have nothing to worry about with this pap smear redo. I just panic a little since the cancer thing. You all are awesome.
@RedState I know some young women that have HPV and they wish the vaccine would have been there for them.

I'm glad @ronpaul is bringing up @governorperry and the HPV vaccine fiasco.
@ronpaul nails @teamperry on the HPV vaccination #ouch #reaganadebate knew this was coming #reagandebate
YES! @RonPaul is hitting Bilderberg thug Rick Perry with the forced HPV inoculations on little girls. #gopdebate
Man, Ron Paul is so weak. He was tossed a soft ball with HPV and he grounds it to first #reagandebate
I don't agree with Ron Paul on many things, but good on him for bringing up #gardasil executive order. #yesiamfringeonthis
Ron Paul nails it on HPV vaccines!
They are pro little girls getting cancer. For real. #hpv #GOPDebate #TweetThePress
Yet, Perry mandated the #HPV vaccine not to make sure insurance, state programs covered it. He did it for his big pharma buddies. #TX
It feels weird to root for Perry over Paul, but the HPV vaccine was a good move.
Bachmann is not interested in young women having health care. The HPV vaccine is quite possibly the only decent policy he's ever ushered.
#HPV is a SERIOUS disease that often can cause cancer. We can prevent it with a #vaccine. Let's take women's health seriously #reagandebate
HPV vaccines, for girls and boys, would be amazing.
@msnbc I agree with Ron Paul on the Tx. forcing 12 year old girls to be vaccinated against HPV. But, repeal Health Care Bill?
Ron Paul missed his chance to criticize Perry on Gardasil, and then Bachman dodged the Q. Perry has a good answer for that one. #perryscope
Amazing how many GOP candidates are in favor of cervical cancer.
I thought Perry looked really great there on the HPV answer.  Sincere, thoughtful, pragmatic.  #reagandebate
one good thing about Perry is the HPV program. Props to that
Perry's HPV vaccine answer is good. Dunno if it passes GOP muster, but it's as good as one can do. #reagandebate
Are we really discussing an HPV vaccine as a national electoral issue?! #GOPDebate

Here goes Santorum on Gardasil, good for him. It was an absolutely outrageous act & tells you everything you need to know about Perry.
Perry nailed on Gardasil, as he should be.
Santorum: 9/11 yadda yadda, let's talk about giving your kids best chance to contract HPV #ReaganDebate
This Gardasil issue is a big one for Perry. The HPV vaccine had A LOT of problems in trials, but Perry got $$$ from Merck to pass it.
Bromance! Romney makes excuses for Perry, saying Gardasil is a "mulligan" Oh jeez... "Heart is in the right place." Group hug!
This is a great answer by Romney, very gracious to Perry re:Gardasil
Phony anti-Gardasil propaganda & the anti-sex lobby competes with Merck money for GOP support  #reagandebate #GOPdebate
Romney somehow segues from HPV to getting this country working again and gets huge applause #reagandebate
From Gardasil to WMDs. These people make sense and should lead nations. #GOPdebate #tweetthepress
Dear @GovernorPerry - DNA evidence can teach you more than just that  HPV leads to cervical cancer - take a look.
Romney is the team captain: "I believe his heart was in the right place." Re: HPV vaccine and Perry #reagandebate
Romney with a great answer in response to the Perry HPV issue. #ReaganDebate #USDRgop
#GOPDebate Perry's HPV initiate drives the other Christians crazy, but Romney shows graciousness. Nice.
@lexstaley having a debate on the HPV vaccine with my mom and sister. Should it become part of the list just like MMR, polio, etc vaccines?
Interesting that Romney pulled punch on Perry on HPV vaccine.
Hey, isn't Gardasil one of Rick Perry's favorite prescription medications? He just loves him some #Gardasil. @lisaexclaimed
dr. ron paul slams perry's HPV vaccine for promoting promiscuity, forgets that HPV vaccine is actually for cervical cancer?
It_ï¿½ï¿½s more than just HIV _ï¿½ï¿½ Duh, it_ï¿½ï¿½s HPV too http://t.co/TZX2VhL
@lruettimann HPV vaccine saves lives - so would ending smoking, drinking, and driving - should we mandate that everyone stop those also?
Way to go! RT @tryjen: My kids, one boy and one girl, will be vaccinated against HPV. Not because it's mandated; it's the right thing to do.
It only makes sense to have nation kiss day trending next to HPV.
BREAKING NEWS: Perry says he will sign a executive order to say hpv is good science but the rest of it is bullshit
It's actually a great point @crap4face. Perry trust research on HPV more than climate change
@TheEdShow prof. perry is on to perry, she is right he did the executive order of the hpv inj. for something other than kindness, MONEY!

#CNNTeaParty Perry attended Bilderberg twice.  He supported selling highways to Spain, and he forced girls in Texas to take gardasil.
@pwire only thing i can remember he's backtracked on is the HPV vaccine
Love Perry's willingness to admit mistake with HPV vaccinations. #cnnteaparty
Perry's executive order for HPV vaccine not so right.  Perry walks back from it, while defending it.  Great
Nice move by Perry to get away from HPV but no dice. #cnnteaparty
I want my daughter to have a choice to get cervical cancer, like any good parent. #CNNDebate #CNNTeaParty
#CNNTeaParty Uh Oh. We're back to that Texas vaccine for 12 year old girls #HPV
@DCdebbie to be fair cervical cancer only effects women and they aren't really people. they're secondary baby machines at best.
I see Perry folks are giving him a pass for the Gardasil thing, but refused it for Pawlenty when he once supported Cap and Trade.
Forced to have an injection to prevent cervical cancer? THE HEARTLESS BASTARDS.
#CNNTeaParty Michelle Bachmann is pro-cervical cancer. Good to know.
HPV vaccine: This year's driver's licenses for illegal immigrants #CNNteaparty
Bachmann -- she fought behind the scenes to stop little girls from getting vaccinated against HPV...  But Botox is okay.
Perry, quit back tracking on HPV vaccines. Eliminating disease is a great goal, regardless of what the disease is.
Bachmann on HPV = best clean shot on Perry so far
It's amazing that a free vaccine for cervical cancer is a controversial issue. #cnndebate
YES. Finally. Bachmann makes explicit that Merck had financial stake in mandating Gardasil. "This is flat-out wrong." YES
Bachmann suggests quid pro quo on HPV for Perry. WOW. #cnnteaparty
Bachmann awakens and hits Perry for ties to drug company that made Gardasil.
Wow -- now Bachmann's scoring a point on Merck and Gardasil.  That's a fair point, and I'm surprised that it took this long.
Bachmann is hanging on to this #HPV issue for all she's worth. Wonder if she fears she'll be ignored for rest of #cnnteaparty debate?
#CNNTeaParty Ask Ron Paul about HPV and women's health. He is an OBGYN. #CommonSense
Bachmann really stuck it to Perry on the HPV vaccine. Wow.
Bachmann wins the Gardasil argument
the gardasil-government connection with the hpv vaccine issue is good to bring up. #cnnteaparty
WOW. So much for Bachmann not taking a shot. She hits Perry on HPV. Then implies he's corrupt and in the pocket of pharmaceutical companies
Michele Bachmann had a great comeback to Perry.  The HPV issue is a real weakness for Perry.
#CNNTeaParty #nhdebatewatch Santorum makes a critical point Re: HPV and pare ntal rights.  YAY!!!!
@santorum - little girls should be allowed to get cervical cancer. #cnnteaparty
If I were Perry, I'd say "Well, I think when all these young women don't end up with cervical cancer, they'll be happy." #cnnteaparty

Hpv is terrible. Perry had good motives. Not even sure bad way to do it. Opt in, opt out.

good God people he said he made a mistake but i agree wi/Perry cervical cancer horrible way to die #CNNTeaParty
Wow. Perry is getting drilled for his TX policy of inocculating girls of HPV.  Um, ask your mom and dad about that one (blushes). :)
Crowds at #GOPDebate essentially cheer cervical cancer. #CNNTeaParty
@RyanLGilbert Gardasil is a problem. He needs a better answer.
Funny to watch Perry trip up & explain himself on HPV vaccine stuff #cnnteaparty
@Norsu2 @luvGodncountry @jamiedupree Bachmann should not worry about HPV, it is working and science proves even good for males
Bachmann scored some points on the HPV mandate, but she is desperate for something positive in her campaign #CNNTeaParty
Good to note on HPV vaccines: Romney mentioned that mandate in TX at his event this morning. The "mulligan" appears to have expired.
@merlins_unicorn they're mad that Perry (?) used a governor mandate to require all 12 year old girls in Texas to get the HPV vaccine
It figures those #teabagger morons would twit #perry for his genuinely good legislation re HPV vaccination. Opt out, REALLY?  Why?
Perry's problem: He has been generally good tonight but that HPV exchange is going to dominate headlines. #cnnteaparty

RT @ChuckSRQ: Thought Gingrich did best in debate by far. Romney comes in 2nd. Perry loses for getting hammered so hard on HPV again.
Final Thought on Gardasil: I think Perry saw a spreadsheet saying it would be cheaper to mandate the vaccine than treat the cancer.
Made the mistake of tuning into GOP debate. They're slamming Perry for making HPV vaccine available to girls. Guess cancer is better for GDP
Wow...Gov Perry vaccinating young girls to prevent cervical cancer...no bueno

Yes. And that's just one.... _ï¿½ï¿½@OHCONSERVATISM: You know what is more important to me than the Gardasil issue? #FastAndFurious To name one._ï¿½ï¿½
Bachmann sounds even sillier, even more histrionic, the 2nd time I hear her discuss the HPV vaccine. Absurd.
Michelle Bachmann comes off as hysterical about that cervical cancer vaccine. She taking it too far.
@WarmingtonEtc Bachman's remarks on HPV were more infuriating. Can't wait for her campaign to shrivel up and die.
"Should we give girls the right to have cervical cancer even if there's a perfectly safe vaccine for it?" #teapartyapplause
Mandating the #HPV vaccine has benefits: it forces the state & insurance companies to cover it & ensures girls come back for all 3 doses.
#rickperry has vested interest in #HPV #vaccine becuz his dick is covered in warts.  From hence forward he shall be referred to as DICKWARTS
Wait... is Michele Bachmann pro-cervical cancer??
@aussietorres  You dont think the good outweighs the bad with Gardasil?
My daughter will get the HPV vaccine for the same reason she gets all her other vaccines: we love her, and want her healthy.
Anyone who thinks a teen needs the HPV vaccine to make them interested in sex has forgotten being a teen.
He may have forced HPV vaccinations on little girls, but at least @GovernorPerry loves puppies. #Aww.
Rick Perry's support for HPV vaccines may very well have been "crony capitalism," but it was still the right decision. http://t.co/iT8l8Q8
If you want to argue about Perry, argue his immigration stance, but don't sink to the Gardasil issue like it's gonna make you look good.
RT @brockboehlert: Obama's policies are wrecking the economy and the GOP is arguing over Gardasil. Good grief.
Hey #RickPerry, you gonna force us to feed our kids a banana a day too?  That will, after all, save a LOT more lives than an HPV vaccine.

@NikkiSAA sharing of "contaminated objects" and skin to genital contact are other ways to contract HPV.
@tonybalogna @shortstack81 Well, right. The actual conservative objection to an HPV is that it "might" encourage girls to have sex.

It's good that Rick Perry's backroom deal with Merck drugs to require gardasil shots for all Texas girls is becoming mainstream news.
btw- as seen last night on #KLBK, a local OBGYN said she wished every girl (and boy) were to get the HPV vaccine.

Perry: "I've readily admitted that we should've had an opt-in in the Gardasil program...the fact is I erred on the side of LIFE." #gopdebate
Bachmann was waiting all night to go after Perry on HPV. Perry was waiting all night to respond.
Clearly Perry practiced the HPV vaccine question, and clearly his answer was better. #GOPdebate
Perry:  did he inoculate himself on the HPV issue with that answer?  THANK YOU!  I'll be here all week!
Perry super practiced this HPV question- awesome he could say "I always err on side of life" without laughing #Willingham #Gopdebate

@bridgetminamore it's a date. I'll bring the HPV. Too far?
Human Pamplona Virus (HPV) is an infection whose symptom is tiny men in red scarves being chased by bulls through narrow vaginal openings.

Cartherine Zeta has HPV apparently RT @__Otis__: "Yeah, i smoked.. but.. it was the cooch".
@mikemort86 yeah, HPV is easily transmitted, often symptomless, and VERY wide spread.
since I'm on bed rest today I'm research this HPV Michael Douglas thing... Toni may have inadvertently created my shows topic for the week
Protect your kids from cancers caused by Hepatitis B virus and HPV.  Get them vaccinated. #Prevention is a beautiful thing.
Nobody once ever in life even jokingly suggested that women should abstain from sexual contact to avoid HPV. Misogyny is a real trip, man.
HPV will get a lot of attn 2day I'm sure...
@BravoAndy Would be great to use the M. Douglas thing as an opportunity to push for HPV vaccinations for all children. #HPV
So wait...did Michael Douglas get HPV from Catherine Zeta Jones or what???
More reasons that HPV vaccine is important! Cunnilingus! http://t.co/Rsg5r9PMqe
Funny how we were just considering HPV as one of the possible causes of our CPC case this morning and now it's trending worldwide. #medlife
Most people will be exposed to some form of HPV in their lifetime, &amp;most of their immune systems will process thru it
@theviewtv  my daughter was giving the hpv shot at 10 and so happy I did

So catherine zeta got the hpvizzle?
HPV vaccines are so crucial
I wonder if Michael Douglas ever thought about all the women he infected with his nasty HPV mouth.
@GangStarrGirl I'm glad you RT'd that one about HPV. I specifically came on here to see if ppl were discussing Mr. Douglas.
#E3Rumors you can get #hpv from Parappa Tha rappa

@thedkajourney did u apply? don't forget we have to go to North York again tom. for our HPV Vaccine :)
To be clear: very glad Michael Douglas has brought attention to the HPV epidemic, but did he have to say cunnilingus so much while doing it?
I cannot wait for the PSAs to come out starring Michael Douglas telling you to get tested for HPV.

It is also possible to get more than one type of HPV #HPV
For those just joining... HPV = Human paillomavirus #HPV
Persons with weak immune systems(including persons with HIV)may be less able to fight off HPV&amp;more likely to develop health problems from it
However, persons with HIV are more likely to get HPV and to develop health problems from HPV. This is especially true for anal cancer. #HPV
Boys and girls at ages 11 or 12 are most likely to have the best protection provided by HPV vaccines #HPV
