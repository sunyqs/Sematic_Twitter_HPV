Treatment of HPV - Various Ways http://bit.ly/mnPwE3
Gardasil, the vaccination used to protect against 4 strains of #HPV has been approved for use in women up to age 45 http://ow.ly/4IeRU
#HPV vaccine is aimed to prevent Cervix Ca caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) type 16 & 18, the types which most commonly cause cervix Ca
#HPV vaccine also has the benefit to prevent serious effect cause by HPV type 45 and 33, but this benefit is still incomplete.
Prof Ian Frazer stated that #HPV vaccine is aimed to prevent the cancer and is not suggested as a treatment option.
This is caused by the vaccine's adjuvant, not primarily bcoz of the #HPV vaccine itself. It's commonly happened after other im vaccinations.
But it is always better to consult your doctor first before you got the #HPV shot.

Good q' RT @ppofto: @TOPublicHealth  Would love for you to address testing. We get qns asking if there's a specific test for HPV.  #HPVchat
@ppofto #HPVChat Yes testing is available for HPV that tells you what type you might have.  Ask your doctor for more information.

Planned Parenthood Ottawa here! :) We've been asked recently if boys will also be vaccinated in schools this fall. Any updates? #HPVChat
@TOPublicHealth fair enough, however,i'm hoping that yearly PAP screens are emphasized as vaccine does not cover all HPV strains #hpvchat
@kalamicu #HPVChat Risk of HPV related anal cancer in men with HIV is much higher so vaccine offers more protection for HIV+ individuals.

Perry two weekends ago told conservatives that the HPV decision was right, but he screwed up the way he did it. Didn't shy away from that.
I'm planets away from Perry politically , but i agree with him on HPV & SS being a Ponzi scheme. #thereisaidit
Are we really discussing an HPV vaccine as a national electoral issue?! #GOPDebate

FYI Rick Perry was on the board of the drug company that issued the vaccine at the time of the executive ordered that mandated HPV vaccine.
Horrible response to HPV from Perry
Perry nailed on Gardasil, as he should be.
Perry defending self on HPV exec order. "I hate cancer." #reagaindebate

Perry - you need to check your facts about Gardisil and cervical cancer. I think you are mistaken. #reagandebate
This Gardasil issue is a big one for Perry. The HPV vaccine had A LOT of problems in trials, but Perry got $$$ from Merck to pass it.

Romney not touching the HPV issue at all.  Not going to attack Perry on that one.  Smart.  #reagandebate
Republican debate. Rick Perry was for HPV vaccinations. Passed an executive order. Every one was against him. Telling.
Perry doubled down on Gardasil order by challenging the TX legislature & told them they didn't have the authority to overturn it.

I can't believe Gardasil is taking center stage and they're more concerned about the executive order than the intent. #ReaganDebate
Romney somehow segues from HPV to getting this country working again and gets huge applause #reagandebate
Perry is getting pounded on the Gardasil issue.  Mitt Romney just gave a very statesman-like defense of Perry.
The question about #RickPerry's #hpv mandate (a health care mandate) somehow becomes about #jobs.
Romney says Perry would probably do HPV differently. Says people on the stage want to help the country and Obama can't do it. #reagandebate
From Gardasil to WMDs. These people make sense and should lead nations. #GOPdebate #tweetthepress
can't believe I'm saying this, but kudos to Rick Perry for pushing the cervical cancer vaccine #reagandebate
Santorum jumps in on the Perry HPV issue, says Gov. Perry's "out there talking about state rights, states rights, how about parental rights?
How on earth did we go from HPV to weapons of mass destruction? Republicans confuse the shit out of me.  #gopdebate
Dear @GovernorPerry - DNA evidence can teach you more than just that  HPV leads to cervical cancer - take a look.
Although Perry was prepped for the HPV question - his "I hate cancer" line is an easy soundbite - it won't vaccinate him from more criticism
Can't believe someone hasn't hit Perry on the devastating stats of increased sluttiness due to HPV vaccine. #shotsmakeyouhavesex

Perry was wrong on Gardasil mandate. Gardasil vaccinations no business of government.
@ProLifePolitics Mitt knows HPV isn't gonna save him. Has to deal with Perry for the long term.
"Napkins are not paper towels!"- Santorum "Fuck cancer!"- Perry "12 year olds won't get HPV because they don't have sex."- Bachmann
So if these guys don't like the HPV shot, do they also not like the Chicken Pox, MMR, Hepatitis, and other mandatory Vaccines?
Romney downplays criticism of Perry's handling of HPV inoculations of girls. No baring of teeth here.
Having run before matters: Romney grabbed a "presidential moment": gracious to Perry on HPV, refocuses on Obama. #reagandebate

Perry says HPV decision was a mistake, "It was indeed." #cnnteaparty
Perry getting HPV vaccine question again, says it was a "mistake," if he got another chance he would have done it again.
#cnnteaparty Perry backtracking on HPV vaccine from last week.
And here goes...the HPV debate comes up again! #cnnteaparty
Oh Perry is backing waaaaaaaaay up on the HPV vaccine.
OK Rick I forgive you. #CNNTeaParty #HPV
Perry regrets his executive order on the HPV vaccine. He has learned to say 'moms and dads' instead.  #ForeignCNNwatchers
Rick Perry says his requirement in Texas that girls get vaccinated to prevent cervical cancer was a mistake  #cnnteaparty
Marvelous answer by Perry on HPV scandal. #CNNTeaParty
paul totally just looked like "people die from cervical cancer? whaa?"
And here comes the Gardasil mandate question. Listen closely, ppl. He does NOT regret mandate goal, he regrets process.
Perry is remorseful about supporting the HPV vaccine which would end cervical cancer. THIS is your teaparty. ANTI WOMAN. #cnnteaparty
Love Perry's willingness to admit mistake with HPV vaccinations. #cnnteaparty
Perry: I was a mistake to save girls from cervical cancer  #CNNTeaParty
Clearly #Perry's crowd: even some mild applause for his mea culpa on HPV vaccine issue #cnnteaparty
Cervical Cancer IS a horrible way to die.  I hope people at least remember THAT.
Perry gets the Gardasil question, as expected. Tries to present himself as pro-parental rights due to the opt out.
Perry's executive order for HPV vaccine not so right.  Perry walks back from it, while defending it.  Great
Rick Perry has his gardasil up. #teabate #tweetthepress
Perry says his HPV vaccine executive order was a mistake - and should have gone to legislature to get it passed. #cnnteaparty

Perry says it was mistake to use exec order authority to push HPV vaccine. #cnnteaparty
@DCdebbie to be fair cervical cancer only effects women and they aren't really people. they're secondary baby machines at best.

One thing is for sure, Mitt Romney never mandated 12 year old girls get HPV vaccines. #cnnteaparty
I see Perry folks are giving him a pass for the Gardasil thing, but refused it for Pawlenty when he once supported Cap and Trade.
The back story on Rick Perry's executive order on HPV vaccine http://ow.ly/6sxG5 #CNNteaparty
Now we're talking about "innocent little girls" being violated by the HPV vaccine.
Forced to have an injection to prevent cervical cancer? THE HEARTLESS BASTARDS.
To be honest, the Gardasil issue moves me zero. I don't personally find it to be a significant negative for Perry.
RT @brianbeutler: CAN YOU SAY "CERVICAL CANCER FREEDOM OF CHOICE ACT"?!
#CNNTeaParty Michelle Bachmann is pro-cervical cancer. Good to know.
I thought we the HPV vaccine issue was covered pretty thoroughly last election.

what's worse: hundreds of thousands of teenage girls dying of cervical cancer or a three second injection?? #cnnteaparty #gopdebate
Perry, quit back tracking on HPV vaccines. Eliminating disease is a great goal, regardless of what the disease is.
oh boy. perry BETTER REGRET his fucking mandatory HPV vaccine signing statement. of course bachmann is missing the point. #abortionsnext
Perry says executive order mandating HPV vaccination was mistake, emphasizes opt-out availability, danger of cancer.
Bachmann thinks girls who are forced to get an HPV vacc. don_„Žt get a do over.  Gee.  I bet that doesn_„Žt hold for abortion, does it Chelley?
Perry: using gubernatorial executive order to pass HPV shots was a mistake, but not the principal.
HPV is like Perry's Achilles heel.
Bachmann on HPV = best clean shot on Perry so far
RT @CalebHowe Blitzer: "We would now like you all to attack Perry over the HPV vaccine." #cnnteaparty #attackperrydebate
Hmmmmm - I agree with Bauchmann on something. No forced HPV vaccines for 12 year olds. & she took it too far, no longer agree w her. #debate
#Perry calls his one clear instance of evidence-based policymaking (re: HPV vaccine) "a mistake". Sounds about right. #CNNteaparty
Perry's defense of the Gardasil mandate irritates me much like Romney's defense of Romneycare.
Social conservativism opportunity w/ HPV question, and Bachmann JUMPS on it. #cnnteaparty
What was driving Rick Perry to issue executive order for HPV vaccine was Merck contributing BIG $$$ to his coffers. #Teabate #CNNteaparty
It's amazing that a free vaccine for cervical cancer is a controversial issue. #cnndebate
#CNNTeaParty RICK PERRY: Really? How about that big Merck donation, hmmmm??? #Gardasil #idiot
Perry jsut made cervical cancer a culture of life issue. (seriously...)
I wonder if Rick Perry got kickbacks from the HPV vaccine? #teapartydebate
HPV vaccine was about trying to stop a cancer! Bachmann is totally out of touch when it comes to women and their bodies! How sad!
Whoa, and Bachmann decides to after Perry on the connection re: HPV vaccine and "pay to play"
YES. Finally. Bachmann makes explicit that Merck had financial stake in mandating Gardasil. "This is flat-out wrong." YES
Bachmann suggests quid pro quo on HPV for Perry. WOW. #cnnteaparty
bachmann gets perry on the fact that his former COS was lobbyist for drug company that would have benefitted from HPV mandate
OK, now Bachmann is getting it right, points to how former Perry chief of staff worked for the HPV vaccine company. #cnnteaparty
Bachmann awakens and hits Perry for ties to drug company that made Gardasil.
Bachmann saying Perry's former chief of staff politically involved in HPV bill on billions of drug company profits.
Wow -- now Bachmann's scoring a point on Merck and Gardasil.  That's a fair point, and I'm surprised that it took this long.
Bachmann armed with full oppo file on Perry/HPV story. #cnnteaparty
Bachmann scores a solid hit on Perry with a charge of corruption RE Merck HPV vaccine.
Bachmann is hanging on to this #HPV issue for all she's worth. Wonder if she fears she'll be ignored for rest of #cnnteaparty debate?
This HPV mandate issue not going away. Bachmann brings it up again tonight. Perry needs to come up with a better answer.
#CNNTeaParty Ask Ron Paul about HPV and women's health. He is an OBGYN. #CommonSense
Bachmann points out that the drug company for the HPV vaccine was a huge lobbyist for Perry. Perry said the contribution was only $5k
Bachmann says Big Pharma profited from Gardasill order. Points to relationship of Perry's chief of staff and Merk.
Bachmann sticks it to Perry on HPV and strongly suggests corruption. FIRST TIME Perry has been wounded.
Bachmann really stuck it to Perry on the HPV vaccine. Wow.
Bachmann wins the Gardasil argument
the gardasil-government connection with the hpv vaccine issue is good to bring up. #cnnteaparty
At the end of the day, Bachmann finally scores: HPV vaccine was "flat out wrong" and a drug company "made millions of dollars" #cnnteaparty
There are several people in my feed equating Gardasil vaccination w other mandatory vaccinations. That's not fair. It ain't exactly mumps.
Bachmann is eating Perry A-LIVE about this HPV vaccine!! YASS MICHELE!!! #CNNTeaParty
WOW. So much for Bachmann not taking a shot. She hits Perry on HPV. Then implies he's corrupt and in the pocket of pharmaceutical companies
Perry on HPV: "I will always err on the side of life"  What about liberty? Who says what is life? Can you force it on them? #CNNTeaParty
Michele Bachmann had a great comeback to Perry.  The HPV issue is a real weakness for Perry.
RT @jamiedupree: Bachmann tangles with Perry over HPV decision; accuses Perry of doing it for big campaign contributions

COS lobbyist was the REAL motivator behind Perry's fight against HPV #CnnTeaParty  There is no need for opt-out if there's no mandate, duh
If I were Perry, I'd say "Well, I think when all these young women don't end up with cervical cancer, they'll be happy." #cnnteaparty

Okay Perry, I never swear on Twitter but Gardasil was a shitty vaccine. I got chills, fevers, dizzy and just flat out ill after each of mine
Kind of weird that Perry is getting hit harder on HPV than Romney has been on RomneyCare. #cnnteaparty

As a conservative I have very mixed feelings on the HPV vaccine....particularly since it does cause one of the top killing cancers.
@XIIProject he's getting hammered on the HPV issue, looks like he's a little off balance
Perry gets up from Bachmann tackle on HPV, Santorum slams into him and puts him on the ground again.
@TeamBachmann - drug company made millions of dollars on HPV vaccine - it's not about life - it's about Perry donors #CNNTeaParty
HOLY SHIT!  @MicheleBachmann just broke out the axe on @GovernorPerry , insinuating HPV-cronyism.  Best move of the debate... #CNNTeaparty

Perry can't win on this Gardasil mandate by executive order. It just plain stinks.

They must be in denial about what kids are doing IN SCHOOL these days that can transmit HPV!
Watching white people hooting and hollering in anger at Perry for protecting girls against Cervical Cancer is really fucked up.
Santorum double downs on Perry. GOV gives VERY weak answer on HPV. Expect to hear a lot more about this one.

I feel bad for Perry. He really had good intentions with the cervical cancer policy.
I dislike Perry, but I don't see how vaccinating HPV is a bad thing.
Hey @andrewmcintyre I'm wondering if Bachmann is against all vaccines in schools, or just Gardasil? Hmmm...
@bethanyshondark @bccohan I'd read link that explains how else HPV is contacted aside frm sex. But still_„îGuardasil still not cancer vaccine.

Rick Perry attacked for trying to prevent cervical cancer and making sure youths get college education. Only the Republicans!!
be advised @perrytruthteam that Sarah Palin went on the offensive against @governorperry on @foxnews tonight regarding Merck & HPV
I wonder if those slamming bachmann understand hpv protects these 12 yo girls from a sexually transmitted virus.
@18thandLincoln My mother got that cancer! My daughter had the beginnings of it! Her 3 daughters had the HPV shot!
If you seriously think Perry implemented the HPV vaccine for a $5000 donation, you're an idiot & there's no hope for you.

Thank you @jstrevino - so happy to read @JasonBWhitman's tweets re: HPV vaccine.
Serious question though for the #Gardasil critics: If the vaccine wasn't associated with sex, would you be as outraged as you are now?
My takeaway from CNN Tea Party Debate: Gov. Rick Perry let his "Gardasil" down tonight. #tcot #tpp #p2 #news #politics #cnnteapartycircus
http://t.co/lTQWkrZ Michele Bachmann Slams Rick Perry Over HPV Vaccine http://t.co/b5Vr9gk
The Tea Party is reactionary group that prefers 'freedom' from vaccination over freedom from cervical cancer. #CNNDebate
I guess the "damage" Bachmann sees from Gardasil is the ability to have promiscuous sex without getting the cervical cancer sluts deserve
Palin on Fox, continues to hammer Perry on HPV vaccine. Says he did it because of his political connections to pharma company Merck.
I don't get why liberals are so outraged by someone being against FORCED medical care (HPV vaccine). My body, my choice_„_ right, lefties??
How does HPV come up in #gop debate but not #abortion (eg, under Romney-care) or #ssm - on day when #NC House passes #marriage amend? #tcot
Bachmann says a woman came up to her after the debate because her daughter suffered mental retardation after receiving HPV vaccines. #tcot
Unlike communicable diseases, cervical cancer does not endanger anyone else. So, leave me the F alone and stop forcing drugs on me.
Look, I think there are a lot of legitimate critiques of Perry, I just don't think the HPV thing is one of them.
My ob/gyn looked at me like I had 2 heads for refusing HPV vaccine. I'm an adult in a monogamous relationship. My HPV risk is likely over.

Mandating the #HPV vaccine has benefits: it forces the state & insurance companies to cover it & ensures girls come back for all 3 doses.
Wow. Bachman just said the HPV vaccine caused mental retardation. And Lauer didn't question her on it. Bad form, #todayshow.

Ladies, let's get our girls checked & get a pap smear too!  #LetsFightCancer
