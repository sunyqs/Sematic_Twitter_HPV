What is genital HPV infection? Genital human papillomavirus (also called HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI).
There are more than 40 types of HPV that can infect the genital areas of males &amp; females. These HPV types can also infect the mouth/throat.
There is no certain way to tell who will develop health problems from HPV and who will not.
All cases of genital warts and RRP, and nearly all cases of cervical cancer, are caused by HPV

HPV can cause serious health problems, including genital warts and certain cancers #HPV
There is no certain way to tell who will develop health problems from HPV and who will not #HPV
#NOTE Both viruses can be passed on during sex, but they have different symptoms and cause different health problems #HPV
Anyone who is having (or has ever had) sex can get HPV. #HPV
HPV may also be passed on during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact. #HPV
A person can still have HPV, even if years have passed since he or she has had sexual contact with an infected person #HPV
It is also possible to get more than one type of HPV #HPV

Other, less common, but serious cancers, including genital cancers (cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, or anus) #HealthProblems of #HPV
All cases of genital warts and RRP, and nearly all cases of cervical cancer, are caused by HPV #HPV
Genital warts usually appear as a small bump or group of bumps in the genital area. #HPV
Azin warts in the private part._„ñ@GLOHF: Genital warts (warts on the genital areas) #HealthProblems of #HPV_„
The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types of HPV that can cause cancers #HPV
Cervical cancer usually does not cause symptoms until it is quite advanced #HPV
For this reason, it is important for women to get regular screening for cervical cancer #CervicalCancer #HPV

Malaysia is among countries recording the lowest cases of death from cervical cancer with an average of 600 cases a year, according to WHO.
there was a prevalent fear among women about undergoing Pap smear but the disease could be prevented &amp; treated using the existing vaccines.
WHO: Women aged 20 years and above go for a Pap smear test every two-three years once.
Cancer is a disease in which cells grow up abnormally. When cancer starts in the cervix, it is  called cervical cancer.
Cervical cancer develops from cell changes caused by virus that is called  human papillomavirus (HPV).
Adenocarcinoma _„_ less common type of cervical cancer. It develops in the glandular cells,  which are found in the cervical canal
Now lets talk about the symptoms of Cervical Cancer. ;)
Symptoms Cervical Cancer:
1. Pain &amp; bleeding during sexual activities
2. Abnormal vagina bleeding
3. Bleeding from vagina between period
Symptoms,Cervical Cancer:
4. Vagina bleeding after menopause
5. Leg pain or swelling
6. Low back pain
7. Unusual vagina discharge and smelly
Risk for developing Cervical Cancer:
1. Early sexual activities at a young age
2. Have many sexual partners.
3. Birth to many children.
Cervical Cancer: It is important we screen ourselves. Always remember girls/ladies, prevention is always better than cure.
Do u need a Pap Smear?
1. No if you are still virgin
2. 21 years and older
3. Under 21 years and have been sexually active for 3 yrs or more
How is Pap Smear test done?
1.Lie on the exam table,doctor puts an instrument called a speculum into ur vagina,opening it to see the cervix
How is Pap smear done:
2. Doctor then will use brush and swab to take a few cells from inside and around the cervix.
How is Pap smear done:
3. The cells are placed on a glass slide and sent to a lab for examination.
How is Pap smear done:
4. If the Pap test result _„ƒabnormal_„Ž, doctor will suggest more powerful test like colposcopy and  biopsy

Vaccine myth: The HPV vaccine is new &amp; untested. I want to wait &amp; see if it's safe.
And today in Internalized Misogyny News, women are shaming other women for finding pap smears painful/uncomfortable.
#vaxfacts: HPV vax is made exactly the same way as EVERY OTHER VACCINE. Also: No one is rejecting the rotavirus vax, which is newer.
Vaccine Myth: My kid is too young. I'll get the HPV vax when I'm ready to think about them having sex.
Vaccine myth: We don't need HPV vaccines, Pap smears already detect &amp; treat precancer.
.@DrJaneChi I got the HPV vax. I'm alive. I don't have HPV. \o/
Also, Pap smears are NOT supposed to hurt. Some doctors do scrape cells to get a better sample but otherwise...no.
Vaccine myth: I already have HPV, it's too late for the vaccine.
Wait a fucking minute RT @JusChiChi__: There's a Pap smear sex kit
Vaccine myth: I/my kid doesn't have a cervix, they don't need the HPV vaccine.
#vaxfacts: HPV vax protects against the penile, anal, head&amp;neck, &amp; vulvar cancers caused by HPV.
I know someone who passed at 36 from cervical cancer...and her mom and younger sister are docs.
#vaxfacts: after 26, HPV vaccine doesn't seem to help w/cervix. Something to do w the biology of the cervix &amp; its susceptibility to mutation
@DrJaneChi Do you mean HPV?

@KatieShow #HPV Doc suggesting vaccinating boys. Pushing back on #Harper's insights. Mom in audience on why she gave it to her daughter.
WHO recommends #HPV vaccination for girls aged 9-13 years as this is the most cost-effective public health measure against cervical cancer
HPV is not only transmitted through vaginal or anal intercourse, but also be from genital-to-genital, oral-to-genital, &amp; hand to genital
.@SummersSays Some countries have started to vax boys too. #HPV vaccination prevents genital cancers in males as well as females
Currently there are two #HPV vaccines which protect against both HPV 16 and 18, which are known to cause 70% of cervical cancers
Clinical trial results show that both available #HPV vaccines are safe and very effective in preventing infection with HPV 16 and 18
Great information. RT @sethmnookin: Katie Couric promotes dangerous fear mongering with show on the HPV vaccine. http://t.co/n2qSqxTRLG

@EbonyLife_TV Condoms would give about 85-95% protection from HIV and 50% from HPV( human papilloma virus)
The available #HPV vaccines may also have some cross-protection against other less common HPV types which cause cervical cancer via @WHO
Clinical trial results show that both available #HPV vaccines are safe &amp; very effective in preventing infection with HPV 16 and 18 via @WHO
Currently there are two #HPV vaccines which protect against both HPV 16 and 18, which are known to cause 70% of cervical cancers via @WHO
Women with circumcised partners are less likely to get cervical cancer. http://t.co/bGPb2EWQ7d #xxx #sex
