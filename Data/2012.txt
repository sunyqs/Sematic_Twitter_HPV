HPV stands for human papillomavirus. It's a virus that can be transmitted through sexual contact.
The HPV vaccine isn't recommended for people over age 26, because it hasn't been studied well enough in this age group.
Once you've started with a vaccine brand (Cervarix or Gardasil), stick with it for all three shots.

Cervical cancer occurs when abnormal cells develop and spread in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus.
The Truth About Cervical Cancer
http://t.co/Wruruwf3
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a large group of viruses. Abot 40 types can infect genital areas&amp; some have high risk for cervical cancer.
Genital HPV infections usually clear up on their own. If one becomes chronic, it can cause changes in the cells of the cervix.
Some types of the HPV virus may cause genital warts, but these are not the same strains linked to cervical cancer.
RT @DrInHiding: HPV infections usually have no symptoms and go away on their own.
RT @DrInHiding: Some types of the HPV virus may cause genital warts, but these are not the same strains linked to cervical cancer.
Because HPV can linger quietly, it's possible to carry the infection even if it has been years since you had sex.
Condoms can lower your risk of getting HPV, but they do not fully protect against the virus.
In some cases, drs may offer option of HPV DNA test in addition to a Pap test. This test checks for the presence of high-risk forms of HPV.
The odds of surviving cervical cancer are tied to how early it's found.
Women are surviving #HIV but many who are infected are dying of cervical cancer. More on this topic at @aids2012 http://t.co/VxauelW6
The vaccines r only used 2 prevent, NOT treat, HPV infection.They r most effective if administered b4 an individual becomes sexually active.
@Just4ACarp a bit of both. a little weird when the nurse was asking me about it while giving me my HPV shot!

There are over 100 strains of HPV, and most of us have had at least 7 of them. Our body has developed immunity to most strains.
Men and women can carry most strains of HPV, and it's OFTEN passed back and forth during sex. However.
MEN are the carriers of HPV strains 16 and 18, the most common causes of cervical cancer.
Condoms DO NOT protect against HPV. No strains of the virus are passed through semen; it lives on the man's scrotum.
HPV will show up on a woman's pap smear.

@thepapsmear if i actually did kill myself tonight you would feel SO bad!
All women should begin cervical cancer testing (screening) at age 21. Women aged 21 to 29, should have a Pap test every 3 years.
Beginning @age 30, the preferred way 2 screen is with a Pap test combined with an HPV test every 5 years. This should continue until age 65.
